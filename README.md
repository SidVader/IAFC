# IAFC - India Against Frauds and Corrupts

IAFC, aims to help people fight corruption.Our services include collection and aggregation of data related to scams and frauds, simplification of filing of cases pertaining to illegal issues and using machine learning for swift detection of the same.

To get started with the application development process, we have created a basic framework for our website. The framework is a basic fraud detector, it classifies the query entered by the client as fraud or genuine(N/F). The output includes the top classification and a confidence score. The framework is build on [IBM Bluemix](https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/) and uses the [Watson's Natural Language Classifier](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/nl-classifier.html). Here, the classifier is trained to determine whether the phrase is related to fraud or genuine(N/F).
